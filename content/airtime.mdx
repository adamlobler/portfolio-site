## Introduction

Airtime is an online UX research tool designed to accelerate the workflow of product teams. It offers two key features: the video call analyzer, which extracts insights and identifies patterns from multiple video calls. You can simply ask questions, and Airtime gathers the answers for you, saving valuable time in the analysis process. The second feature is the website survey widget, which allows users to seamlessly collect and summarize responses directly on their websites, eliminating the need to manually sift through feedback.

## Problem statement

During our initial research phase, we gathered insights from professionals across various industries who frequently conduct user interviews. The feedback was clear: UX research is a time-intensive and laborious process, often requiring teams to spend countless hours analyzing video call transcripts and reviewing user feedback. This inefficiency made it challenging for companies to derive actionable insights quickly and effectively.

On a personal note, when I joined the project, I noticed that the team didnâ€™t yet have a consistent design system or well-established design processes in place. This presented a unique challenge: in addition to addressing the UX research bottleneck, I needed to establish design standards that would bring consistency and streamline the development process moving forward.

## Process

#### Research & Insights Gathering

We began the project by gathering insights from UX experts to better understand their current research workflows. This included exploring what tools they use, how long the process typically takes, and the main bottlenecks they face. The answers to these questions provided valuable context for shaping our design direction.

#### Team Discussions & Market Overview

Next, we discussed the gathered insights with the team and conducted a market overview to analyze similar tools and their offerings. This research helped us identify opportunities where Airtime could introduce new features and bring additional value to researchers.

#### Design Exploration & Iteration

With the initial feature scope defined, I created multiple design variants to explore different solutions. After presenting these concepts to the team, we selected one and made refinements based on their feedback.

#### Prototyping & User Testing

I developed a prototype and participated in user testing to observe and gather feedback directly from researchers. These insights were crucial in refining the design.

#### Final Design & Handoff

Based on the feedback from user testing, I refined the design and created the final variant, which was then handed off to production.

## Results

What started as a startup with a single feature has evolved into a comprehensive platform that researchers actively use. Through continuous iteration and user feedback, Airtime has grown into a valuable tool that streamlines UX research workflows. Today, Airtime has paying customers, including UX agencies that integrate it into their daily processes, helping them save time and gain deeper insights from user interviews.
