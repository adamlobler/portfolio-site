# Summary

## Overview

ViddL was founded in 2017 by young people who believed that there was a need for
change in the package delivery industry. They thought that with better technological
infrastructure, the industry could be renewed, as there had been little innovation
in this area in recent years. They started working hard and achieved the goal of
delivering thousands of packages every day throughout Hungary.

ViddL contracts with large logistics companies and manages the last mile delivery
of packages with the help of pedestrian/cyclist couriers. Every morning, thousands
of packages arrive at the ViddL depot from the companies, and then the couriers deliver
them to the addresses using a mobile application. The recipients are notified about
the delivery through a multi-level system. Since they continuously optimize the package
route, they are able to tell the exact arrival time of the courier.

## My Responsibilities

I started working with ViddL when the courier application and their internal
admin system were already done, and the delivery was already in progress. As a startup
company, the initial system was an MVP with minimal functionality and a slightly
clumsy appearance, but it managed to handle daily deliveries without major issues.

My task was to unify the appearance of the ViddL applications and create a design
system that developers can easily implement. Then based on this system, I had to
redesign the ViddL applications step by step to make them easier to use.

## Result

During our two-year collaboration, we managed to build a unified design system library
that can be used quickly and efficiently for future developments. We completely redesigned
the package tracking system, making it possible to notify recipients much more accurately
about the arrival of packages.

The courier mobile application also received a fully functional modern interface
that better tracks the delivery process and provides simpler use for the couriers.
The admin interface also received a new user-centered appearance, making it easier
for courier coordinators, depot managers, and management to follow the daily delivery.

# Package tracking site

## Problems

### One more feature, one more section.

Recipients can stay informed about the status of their incoming package through the
package tracking site. Here, they can modify delivery time/address or request to have
their ordered product delivered to a package pick-up point.

Whenever a new feature was introduced on the website, developers solved it by adding
a new section, resulting in a rather lengthy scrollable page. Unfortunately, this
had the consequence that customer service was frequently overwhelmed with inquiries
about information that was available on this interface but went unnoticed by users,
causing a heavy workload for the colleagues.

### You can never notify too early.

ViddL sends multiple notifications to recipients regarding the delivery time of their
package on the day it arrives. These emails are sent after the courier start working.
As some couriers only started working later, even after lunchtime, there were several
complaints that recipients received notifications too late and could not plan their
day around the given time window.

Another recurring complaint related to this was
that the time window given to recipients was too broad, so they couldn't plan their
day accordingly.

## Solutions

### Defining new estimation points for accurate forecasting.

In response to feedback, I worked together with management to create a user-flow
for package arrivals, which visually and clearly outlined the morning processes of
ViddL depots. After creating the flow, we defined points during package processing
and delivery where we could obtain additional information about the delivery time.

  />

As a result, we were able to send out a 3-hour time slot to recipients much earlier,
even in the early morning hours. As we gathered more information in advance about the delivery
(such as how many packages the courier had planned, their mode of transportation)
we were able to determine more accurate time slots for package arrival. We kept users
informed of these interval updates until they received the final email about a
5-minute time slot.

During the project, there was a fear that the many emails would be counterproductive
and annoy users, but we took the risk because of the more precise notifications.
Eventually it turned out that there was no need to worry.

### Above the fold

In addition to the notifications, the other problem was the overload of the customer
service. As I mentioned, users often contacted them for information that was already
available on the package tracking page but they couldn't find it.

Most users didn't even scroll through the page, so they had no chance of finding
the necessary features or information. In addition, the most important information
for the recipients - the delivery time - was in the middle of a data list, which
users didn't always find.

In response to the feedback, I completely redesigned and restructured the page. I
aimed to display the data as concisely and clearly as possible, so that the most
important ones would catch the recipients' attention immediately after opening the
page.

## Results

During live testing, the workload of customer service drastically decreased from
one day to the next, as significantly fewer recipients called customer service compared
to before.

Internal and Google reviews also included feedback praising the continuous
and accurate information provided.

# More details coming soon...

<br />
For a designer making a portfolio is an everlasting task. So the documentation of
this project is still in progress. Sorry for that, but I have some mockups and screenshots
that I can share with you until then! :)
