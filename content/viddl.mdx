## Overview

ViddL was founded in 2017 by young people who believed that there was a need for
change in the package delivery industry. They thought that with better technological
infrastructure, the industry could be renewed, as there had been little innovation
in this area in recent years. They started working hard and achieved the goal of
delivering thousands of packages every day throughout Hungary.

ViddL contracts with large logistics companies and manages the last mile delivery
of packages with the help of pedestrian/cyclist couriers. Every morning, thousands
of packages arrive at the ViddL depot from the companies, and then the couriers deliver
them to the addresses using a mobile application. The recipients are notified about
the delivery through a multi-level system. Since they continuously optimize the package
route, they are able to tell the exact arrival time of the courier almost to the
minute.

## My Responsibilities

I started working with ViddL when the courier application and their internal
admin system were already done, and the delivery was already in progress. As a startup
company, the initial system was an MVP with minimal functionality and a slightly
clumsy appearance, but it managed to handle daily deliveries without major issues.
My task was to unify the appearance of the ViddL applications and create a design
system that developers can easily implement. Then based on this system, I had to
redesign the ViddL applications step by step to make them easier to use.

## Result

During our two-year collaboration, we managed to build a unified design system library
that can be used quickly and efficiently for future developments. We completely redesigned
the package tracking system, making it possible to notify recipients much more accurately
about the arrival of packages. The courier mobile application also received a fully
functional modern interface that better tracks the delivery process and provides
simpler use for the couriers. The admin interface also received a new user-centered
appearance, making it easier for courier coordinators, depot managers, and management
to follow the daily delivery.
